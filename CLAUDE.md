# Claude Code Instructions

## What to check first
1. Read **README.md** to understand the overall project.
2. Refer to detailed documents in the `docs/` directory as needed.

## Implementation Notes

### Requirements Definition
- Before coding, make the requirements as concrete as possible.
- Start coding only when the user explicitly requests it.

### **Never** guess specifications
If anything is unclear, clarify it *before* coding by:
1. Asking the user questions.
2. Searching the web for documentation.
3. Reading the existing source code.

### Iterate with minimal implementations
- Break the work into the smallest possible steps.
- After each step, ensure the project is in a “working” state.
- If it doesn’t work, revert the changes and rethink the approach and steps.
